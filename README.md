# PPSProject – GitHub Activity Viewer

Hi there!

This is PPSProject, a simple ASP.NET Core MVC web app that shows your latest GitHub activities — commits, pull requests, issues — all in one place.

## Features

- View recent GitHub activities in a clean list  
- Search activities easily  
- Mark activities as "Read Later" or "Favourite"  
- Pagination with 15 items per page  
- Light/Dark mode toggle with saved preference  
- Sort activities by Date or Type by clicking column headers  

## How it works

- Activities are stored in memory, so data resets on app restart  
- Mark items with ⭐ for favourite and 📑 for read later  
- Dark mode preference saved in browser localStorage  
- Sorting and filtering happen server-side for simplicity
